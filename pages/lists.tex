\section{Lists and Tuples}

\subsection{Lists}
Haskell lists are represented as linked lists.
A node in a linked list can either be \emph{Nil} or a pointer to the \emph{next node}.

Lists have a \emph{head} and a \emph{tail}. Because of Haskell being lazily evaluated, lists can be infinite.
\emph{take} takes \emph{n} items from a list, and \emph{drop} drops \emph{n} items from a list.\\
\\
list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\\
In the above list, the \emph{head} is \underline{1}, and the \emph{tail} is \underline{[2, 3, 4, 5]}

The \emph{splitAt} function splits a list into two parts at the element specified
\begin{verbatim}
Prelude> splitAt 5 [1..10]
([1,2,3,4,5],[6,7,8,9,10])
\end{verbatim}

Lists can be indexed using the \emph{!!} operator.

\subsection{Tuples}
Haskell has tuples, triples, and \emph{n-tuples}. Tuples have a \emph{fst} and \emph{snd} function which
respectively gets either the first \underline{or} second item. 

\emph{swap} (defined in \textbf{Data.Tuple}) swaps the items in a \emph{tuple}

\begin{lstlisting}
("char", 20)

-- a triple
("char", 20, "turtles")
\end{lstlisting}
